tasks priority_queue 
ready queue

initialize tasks with all the arrival times

while (tasks OR ready not empty):
	if task is empty:
		add front of ready

	grab next task in tasks

	if task is cpu finished:
		add back to task its io finish time
		grab next in ready, calculate its cpu finish and add to tasks
	else if task is arrival: 
		add to ready queue
	else if task is io finished:
		move index
		add to ready queue	





arrival 
cpu -> io -> back to ready
    ^ 
  add next ready

if not running and ready not empty:
	run the next in ready

grab next task

if task is done (index is beyond its burst time)
	continue

	running = false
	update system_time
	switch to io
if io done:
	increment index
